A stranger offers you two routes. Each route could be represented by a distinct line

of instructions written on the same piece of paper; these cartographic and 
propositional representations differ in format. The format of a representation 
constrains its possible contents. For example, a representation with a cartographic 
format cannot represent what is represented by sentences such as `There could not be a 
mountain whose summit is inaccessible.'\footnote{ Note that the distinction between 
content and format is orthogonal to issues about representational medium. The maps in 
our illustration may be paper map or electronic maps, and the instructions may be spoken, 
signed or written. This difference is one of medium.} The distinction between content and 
format is necessary because, as our illustration shows, each can be varied independently 
of the other.

Suppose you are given some verbal instructions describing a route. You are then shown a representation of a route on a map and asked whether this is the same route that was verbally described. You are not allowed to find out by following the routes or by imagining following them. 
Special cases aside, answering the question will involve a process of translation because two distinct representational formats are involved, propositional and cartographic. It is not be enough that you could follow either representation of the route. You will also need to be able to translate from at least one representational format into at least one other format.

One way to do this might be to test your performance on different tasks.  If the representation is propositional you are likely to be relatively fast at identifying key landmarks but relatively slow at translating the route into a sequence of compass directions; but the converse will be true if your representation is cartographic.

For this comparison we need to distinguish two ways of imagining seeing. There is a way of 
imagining seeing which phenomenologically is something like seeing except that it does not 
necessarily involve being receptive to stimuli. This way of imagining seeing, sometimes 
called `sensory imagining', is commonly distinguished from cognitive ways of imagining 
seeing which might for example involve thinking about seeing.
It is this way of imagining seeing an object move that we wish to compare with actually 
seeing an object move.

For ordinary subjects, the tasks differ: they are less accurate 
when the hand's position is biomechanically awkward. 
But <span class='grey-text'>Fiori et al. (2013)</span> show that the tasks do not so differ for subjects suffering Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which impairs motor representation <span class='grey-text'>(Parsons, Gabrieli, Phelps, &#38; Gazzaniga, 1998)</span>.
</div><div class="notes">It may be objected that performance differences such as these can be explained without appealing to
a difference in format. After all, rotating a ball involves an action whereas a ball rotating does
not; consequently, imagining the former may be thought to differ from imagining the latter with
respect to the contents of the representations involved. Supposing that there are differences in
content here and in other cases, could these fully explain differences in performance profile? To
see why not, consider two tasks involving mental rotation. Judging the laterality of a rotated
letter is thought to involve phenomenologically vision-like imagination
<span class='grey-text'>(Jordan, Heinze, Lutz, Kanowski, &#38; Jäncke, 2001)</span>, whereas judging the laterality of a rotated hand is thought to involve
phenomenologically action-like imagination (<span class='grey-text'>Parsons, 1987</span>; <span class='grey-text'>Gentilucci, Daprati, &#38; Gangitano, 1998</span>).
Ordinary subjects who are asked to judge the laterality of a hand rotated to various degrees are
less accurate when the hand's position is biomechanically awkward. By contrast, no such effect
occurs for comparable tasks involving letters rather than hands. How could this difference in
performance in imagining hands and letters be explained? Consider the claim that the difference in
performance can be fully explained by a difference in the content of the representations involved.
Initially this might seem plausible because one task involves hands whereas the other involves
letters. However, there are subjects who can perform both tasks but whose performance is not
different for hands and letters <span class='grey-text'>(Fiori et al., 2013)</span>. These are subjects suffering Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which impairs motor representation <span class='grey-text'>(Parsons et al., 1998)</span>. Since
ALS and ordinary subjects encounter the same stimuli and perform the same tasks, there seems to be
no reason (other than our hypothesis about a difference in format) to suppose that the two groups'
performance involves representations with different contents. So if the hand-letter difference in
performance were entirely explained by a difference in content, we would expect ALS and ordinary
subjects to exhibit the same difference in performance. But this is not the case. This is an
obstacle to supposing that the hand-letter difference in performance in ordinary subjects could be
explained by appeal to content.</div><p class="source"><span class='grey-text'>Fiori et al.

Why suppose that
motor representations also differ in format from intentions? Contrast two ways of imagining taking a
shot in basketball, one involving the phenomenologically action-like kind of imagination and the
other involving a cognitive kind of imagination. The contrast we require is roughly between the way
a former player might imagine this and the way that someone who has only ever read about basketball
might imagine it. As we have seen, the way phenomenologically action-like imagination unfolds in
time and the amount of effort it involves will depend on bio-mechanical, dynamical and postural
constraints, among others. These constraints are closely related to those which govern actually
performing such actions <span class='grey-text'>(Jeannerod, 2001)</span>, and some can be altered by acquiring or losing
motor expertise. By contrast no such constraints would be expected always to apply where a cognitive
kind of imagination is involved. In line with the general strategy of inferring differences in
format from differences in characteristic performance profile, we conclude that motor
representations differ in format from those involved in cognitive kinds of imagination, which are
plausibly propositional.
